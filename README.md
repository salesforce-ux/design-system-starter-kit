![Starter Kit by Salesforce UX](https://rawgit.com/salesforce-ux/design-system-starter-kit/master/starter-kit.svg)

Rapid prototyping environment using the [Salesforce Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/), HTML, and [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.com/).

## Who is this for?

From the prototyper to the large application developerâ€¦ the Design System Starter Kit
is a helpful tool to get started and run prototypes of all sizes in the browser.

### Designers

The starter kit is built using web standards, more specifically HTML and CSS.
Copy and pasting markup from <https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/> is quick and easy.
No need to be a front-end guru to start designing in the browser!

### Salesforce Developers

Setting a whole demo org for a quick prototype can take time and effort,
whereas cloning the starter kit and putting a few components together only takes a few minutes.
Deploying your prototype to Heroku for free â€“ in only 2 clicks â€“ is also lightning fast!

## Set-up (private) ðŸ”’
If you plan to have internal-facing work in your starter kit app that you don't want public, using a private repository is recommended. One method to achieve that is to import this Starter Kit repository into a new private one ([details](https://help.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer)):

1. Open https://github.com/new/import
1. In the **Your old repository's clone URL** field, enter: `https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system-starter-kit`
1. In the **Your new repository details** field, enter a unique name for your new starter kit repository.
1. Under **Privacy**, be sure to select the Private option :)
1. Click **Begin Import**
1. Once your new repository is created, move onto [Quick Start](#quick-start)

## Set-up (public)
1. Fork this repository or [download it](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system-starter-kit/archive/master.zip) onto your computer

## Quick Start

Pre-requisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 4.2 or up.

1. Clone your new repository onto your computer if you've imported or forked.
1. In a terminal, `cd` into the directory where you cloned or downloaded your Starter Kit repository.
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run dev` (or `gulp`)
1. Open <http://localhost:3000>

Thatâ€™s it! You can start by editing the `src/views/index.html` file and build awesome prototypes.

Tip: copy markup from the [Lightning Design System Components](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/components-overview/) and paste it into the HTML files of the starter kit.

## Deploy to Heroku

## FAQ

### Which browsers does the Starter Kit support?

When it comes to the CSS, the Starter Kit has the same support level as the Lightning Design System itself.
See [the list of supported browsers](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/faq/#what-browsers-are-supported).

For JavaScript, at the moment only a few very recent browsers are supported (Chrome & Firefox recommended).

### Is there a showcase of prototypes using the Starter Kit?

Not yet, but weâ€™d love to know about your creations! Feel free to get in touch in the [issues of the project](https://github.com/salesforce-ux/design-system-starter-kit/issues).
In the mean time, you can [check out the example prototype](https://starter-kit-demo.herokuapp.com/example.html).

### How do I update to use the latest version of the Salesforce Lightning Design System?

If you've had this project installed for a while, the SLDS version will stay the same as the version that was current when you cloned the project. To update to the latest public release of SLDS, in Terminal, run:

`npm update @salesforce-ux/design-system`

### How would I update my fork if Salesforce updates the Starter Kit?

To sync your fork, browse to: `{{your GitHub and repository URL}}/compare/master...salesforce-ux:master`

On that page, click `Create pull request` and proceed to merge the pull request if all looks good.

Then, in Terminal, from your fork's project folder, run:

```
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

Or, in GitHub Desktop, click `Fetch origin` and then `Pull origin`
