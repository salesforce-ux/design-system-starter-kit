# Views

This is where all of your pages and templates live.

## Nunjucks

The starter kit uses a powerful (but optional) templating engine:
[Nunjucks](http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/).

The syntax is very close to traditional HTML, allowing designers and
developers alike to get comfortable with the code really quickly.

## Pages

Views are HTML or Nunjucks files, e.g. `index.html`, `filename.html`.
Each page is accessible at `http://your-domain/filename.html`.
Add as many as needed, and link between them like you would with classic HTML.

## Templates and partials

A default template is provided in [`_template.html`](_template.html).

Partials should have a name of the form `_partial.html` (e.g. `_page-header.html`).

## Examples

- [`example.html`](example.html): shows what you can achieve in minutes with the starter kit
- [`workshop.html`](workshop.html): boilerplate for the [Dreamforce 2016 workshop](http://sfdcworkshop.com/workshop/rapid-prototyping-with-slds/)
