   suggestions or let you know if there is already an effort in progress.
2. Fork off this repository.
3. Create a topic branch for the issue that you are trying to add.
   When possible, you should branch off the default branch.
4. Edit the code in your fork.
5. Send us a well documented pull request when you are done.

The **GitHub pull requests** should meet the following criteria:

We’ll review your code, suggest any needed changes, and merge it in. Thank you.
